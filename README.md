# Project Overview

This project explores Instacart customer purchasing behavior using Python. The analysis covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory visualizations to uncover patterns in customer loyalty, spending habits, and demographics. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project identifies key customer profiles (e.g., Established Families, Young Adults, Mature Affluent) and their ordering habits across regions and product departments. The results help inform marketing and sales strategies for customer targeting and retention.
